An observational trial in 27 patients found a compromised lactate conversion in patients with liver disease, those on inotropic support, and in patients with initial blood lactate measurements of >10 mmol/L and large base deficits.

Therefore, the consulting physician should assume women are being treated with NSAIDs and confirm with the hospital staff. Risk factors for postpartum exacerbation of hypertension include antepartum hypertension, older age, and NSAID use. In fact, in most women, blood pressure is highest in the first 1–2 weeks postpartum, so most likely this patient’s blood pressure will increase in the next few days rather than decrease. Therefore, NSAIDs should be discontinued, and labetalol, which can be taken while breastfeeding, should be started. Although captopril gets into breast milk in very small amounts, little information is available regarding the safety of lisinopril during breast feeding, so this medication should be avoided. HCTZ does not get into breast milk in clinically significant amounts and is considered safe; however, it may be associated with decreased milk production. It would not be prudent to discharge the patient without some treatment strategy, especially if she is still taking NSAIDs, because her blood pressure is likely to increase rather than decrease in the next few days. Although nifedipine XL is an acceptable medication for pregnancy and lactation, the patient should be followed more closely to assess response to treatment.

High dietary sodium intake will also increase his plasma sodium and osmolality. When osmolality of extracellular fluid increases, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus shrink and stimulate thirst. Thus, lowering the dietary sodium and lowering his dialysate sodium will both help reduce thirst and minimize interdialytic weight gain.

The derivative of these plants, aristolochic acid, is nephrotoxic and leads to a chronic interstitial nephritis. Most importantly is the lifelong risk in these patients of transitional cell carcinoma especially after transplantation, where it may occur in >30% of patients (option E). It has been recommended that a bilateral nephrectomy be considered prior to transplant in patients with aristolochic acid nephropathy. The normal creatinine level and gross hematuria are inconsistent with acute humoral rejection, and the presence of a living donor kidney also makes this less likely. There are no constitutional symptoms to suggest CMV, and CMV does not cause hemorrhagic cystitis. BK viremia is an important cause of hemorrhagic cystitis but the risk factors for BK are not present. This patient never had a recently described rejection episode requiring an increase in immunosuppression. In addition, BK nephropathy should be associated with allograft dysfunction.

Osmolality is a property of the aqueous component of the sample so that the plasma osmolality remains normal, and there is a “gap” between the osmolality calculated from the serum sodium concentration, BUN, and blood glucose and the measured value. Measurement of the serum or plasma sodium concentration with an ion-specific electrode without dilution of the sample (direct potentiometry) shows that the sodium concentration is really normal. However, measurement of the sodium concentration with indirect potentiometry (used in most automated devices) requires a dilution step that will yield an artifactually low value. Diluting the sample requires that an aliquot of serum or plasma be obtained; that aliquot will contain a lower than normal amount of plasma water. The plasma and serum sodium concentrations will not be different in pseudohyponatremia; a comparison of plasma and serum potassium is indicated in cases of suspected pseudohyperkalemia caused by release of potassium from platelets during the clotting process.'},\n",

When proteinuria is about 2 g, the drug is typically stopped until proteinuria improves, and then it may be restarted at a lower dose or a longer interval between treatments.

Remember that acetone, while a ketone, is a very weak acid, so ingestion of acetone results in ketosis without acidosis. lsopropanol intoxication results from its accidental ingestion or its use in suicide attempts or when used in lieu of ethanol. The most common laboratory abnormality is an increase in the serum osmolality. Metabolic acidosis is usually absent, unless hypotension is sufficient to produce lactic acidosis. Because one of the major metabolites of isopropanol is acetone, the nitroprusside reaction will be positive. The triad of normal acid-base parameters, hyperosmolality, and a positive nitroprusside (urine ketones) reaction of urine and/or blood should suggest this diagnosis. Supportive measures are often sufficient if the patient is not comatose and/or hypotensive. If hypotension is present along with coma, then initiation of hemodialysis has been recommended. Given the effectiveness of dialysis in removing isopropanol and the safety of this procedure, it seems reasonable to initiate hemodialysis in the presence of severe coma, hypotension, or serum isopropanol levels >200 mg/dL. Since acetone (the primary metabolite) is less toxic than isopropyl alcohol (the parent alcohol), there is no indication for alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition with fomepizole or ethanol following isopropyl alcohol exposure. Toluene (glue sniffing) results in a severe non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (not present here) that may appear to be distal RTA because the urinary anion gap is also positive. But this finding is not from a lack of urinary NH4+, which is the hallmark of D-RTA; the urinary anion gap is positive, even though there is adequate NH4+ excretion, because of anion metabolites (benzoate and hippurate) that are easily excreted by the kidney.

Ethanol can be considered an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor because it ties up the enzyme. When ethylene glycol or methanol is ingested with ethanol, it may be somewhat protective.

Allopurinol is a fairly safe drug if dosed appropriately for level of kidney function. It will help reduce further uric acid production but will not correct hyperuricemia.

Because IVIG significantly increases the total protein content of blood, pseudohyponatremia can occur as the solid component of blood increases (the same situation can occur with severe hyperlipidemia). The typical laboratory method of measuring serum sodium (indirect ion selective) will produce a low result. However, the plasma osmolality measurement will be normal (an osmolar gap will be present), and the serum sodium value will be normal if measured by a direct ion selective method.',\n",
       "  'explanation_text': 'The other mechanism is related to the vehicle or carrier for the IVIG: sucrose or maltose. These sugars can accumulate in the blood (especially if renal failure is present). Because they do not enter cells, the result can be osmotic disequilibrium between the cellular and the extracellular compartments, pulling water out of cells and diluting the sodium concentration in the extracellular compartment. This is similar to what happens with hyperglycemia, but without an osmolal gap because glucose can be measured and included in the calculated serum osmolality. For this patient, neither sucrose nor maltose is measured, so you will have an osmolal gap, but when measured by direct ion selective methods, the serum sodium will sti ll be low because of the water movement. The osmolal gap in this patient is from the retained sucrose, but the serum sodium is actually low when studied with direct ion selective electrodes. In effect, this is not true pseudohyponatremia at all; that term should be reserved for situations in which the serum sodium is low with indirect ion selective methods but normal with direct ion selective methods.

When he undergoes dialysis against a dialysate sodium of 140 mg/dL, this results in an elevated dialysate-to-plasma sodium gradient, which favors sodium diffusion from dialysate to plasma. As a consequence, his plasma sodium will increase during dialysis. This will stimulate thirst to reduce his plasma sodium (and osmolality) back to his set point. High dietary sodium intake will also increase his plasma sodium and osmolality. When osmolality of extracellular fluid increases, osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus shrink and stimulate thirst. Thus, lowering the dietary sodium and lowering his dialysate sodium will both help reduce thirst and minimize interdialytic weight gain. Reducing his free water intake is not correct because the stimulus for thirst is the increase in osmolality. Adding a new antihypertensive medication is not appropriate at this time as it is possible that reducing his interdialytic weight gain may help improve his high predialysis BP.',\n",

With the osmotic force of proteins in plasma, the effective gradient favors the movement of sodium from dialysate to plasma even though the difference would be anticipated to favor movement to the dialysate. Thus, answer A is not correct in that a dialysate Na of 140 mEq/L is not appropriate for all patients, particularly those patients who have a very low predialysis sodium. Answer B is incorrect as it fails to take into consideration the Gibbs-Donnan effect, and thus, a dialysate sodium 5-10 mEq/L higher than serum will not result in isonatric dialysis.

This patient likely has milk-alkali syndrome (also called calcium-alkali syndrome to signify that it is a high calcium intake and not necessarily milk only that is a key determinant of this syndrome). Milk-alkali syndrome is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of calcium and absorbable alkali, with resulting hypercalcemia. If unrecognized and untreated, milk-alkali syndrome can lead to metastatic calcification and renal failure. Calcium-alkali syndrome is now more common in postmenopausal women with the use of over-the-counter (OTC) calcium and vitamin D supplements. Calcium- or milk-alkali syndrome is now the third most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients.',\n",
       "  'explanation_text': 'Calcium absorption is completed within 4 hours of intake. Avid absorption of large doses may lead to suppression of PTH, which then leads to enhanced bicarbonate retention by the kidney. (The data are clear that PTH is suppressed in milk-alkali syndrome.) Continuing ingestion of calcium carbonate and bicarbonate retention leads to alkalosis, which causes increased calcium resorption (cut off) Resultant dehydration and volume depletion (with a resulting low urine sodium) may worsen the hypercalcemia. PTH is further suppressed by hypercalcemia. This cyclic pathophysiology maintains hypercalcemia and alkalosis as long as calcium and alkali are taken in by mouth. A low PTH level impairs gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of phosphate. Therefore, low PTH levels may be part of the mechanism by which phosphate levels either remain normal or rise abnormally high in many patients.'},\n",

A few patients, however, have symptomatic hypocalcemia. Children in particular may become symptomatic with seizures and neuromuscular irritability during periods of stress, such as a febrile illness, and may be mislabeled as having febrile seizures. The biochemical features are as follows: • Serum calcium concentration usually in the range of 6 -8 mg/dL (1.5-2.0 mmol/L), but as low as 5 mg/dL in occasional families; • Normal (or only slightly low) serum PTH concentrations; • High or high normal urinary calcium excretion rather than the expected low excretion; • Recurrent nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, particularly during treatment with vitamin D and calcium supplementation; • No previous normal serum calcium values; and • Low serum magnesium concentration (in some). The usual biochemical tests do not reliably discriminate this disorder from other forms of PTH-deficient hypoparathyroidism. In addition to the features listed above, the major clinical clue to this syndrome is its familial nature and the tendency of patients to develop renal complications during treatment with calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy were mild, involving approximately 5% of the renal cortex. Frozen sections for immunofluorescence contained 15 glomeruli. There was granular mesangial and scattered glomerular capillary fluorescence for C3 (Image 3) No glomerular staining was seen with antibodies to IgG, IgA, IgM, kappa and lambda light chains, C1q, and fibrinogen. Ultrastructural examination revealed scattered large subepithelial “humps” along the glomerular capillary loops (Image 4). Occasional intramembranous and mesangial deposits were also noted (Image 5). Podocyte foot process effacement was widespread. The patient was treated with conservative renoprotective measures, and NSAIDs were discontinued. No immunosuppressive medications were given. Two weeks later the patient’s serum creatinine decreased to 1.72 mg/dL (eGFR, 36 mL/min/1.73m2 ) and her edema decreased substantially. Nowadays, we rarely see poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in kidney biopsy material, particularly in adults. The differential diagnosis is primarily C3 glomerulonephritis/glomerulopathy and glomerulonephritis associated with nonstreptococcal infections. Heavy nephrotic proteinuria is unusual in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis; in this patient, morbid obesity and, perhaps NSAID use, may have aggravated the proteinuria. Other infectious agents may cause similar histology, but the history of pharyngitis three weeks before presentation, the C3-dominant glomerular subepithelial deposits (“humps”), the low serum C3 level, the slightly elevated ASO titer, and the improvement in kidney function and proteinuria without steroid treatment all favor of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. C3 glomerulonephritis is a relatively recently described entity and bears many similarities to postinfectious/poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. In fact, the differential diagnosis can be quite difficult because patients with C3 glomerulopathy frequently have low serum C3 levels and may even have subepithelial “humps.” There is some evidence that, occasionally, infections, including streptococcal infections, can initiate the development of C3 glomerulonephritis. In such cases, the glomerular disease starts as a postinfectious glomerulonephritis, but unlike postinfectious glomerulonephritis, it will not resolve and becomes a chronic, persistent, slowly progressive form of glomerulonephritis. IgG deposits are absent or very mild in C3 glomerulopathy. In poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, IgG deposits may or may not be present. In our experience, it is common to see C3-dominant or only C3-positive glomerular capillary deposits in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, making the differential diagnosis even more difficult. Also, IgG deposits may be masked and can only be revealed following antigen retrieval (protease digestion of the paraffin sections). If any doubt, we and others recommend performing immunofluorescence for immunoglobulins following protease digestion of paraffin sections, which can unmask the IgG in the deposits. It is important to differentiate C3 glomerulopathy from poststreptococcal or infection-associated glomerulonephritis because of the very different treatment approaches and outcomes. If an apparent poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis does not achieve remission, C3 glomerulonephritis (or if IgG is present, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis) should be considered. The best method diagnosing C3 glomerulopathy is testing for alternate pathway complement regulatory abnormalities, including genetic abnormalities in alternate pathway regulatory proteins or autoantibodies to them, such as C3 nephritic factor. While poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis became a rare diagnosis in the everyday renal pathology practice, the number of cases with staphylococcus infection–associated glomerulonephritis is on the rise. In staphylococcus-associated glomerulonephritis, the staphylococcus infection is frequently still ongoing; therefore, the term postinfectious glomerulonephritis should not be used. Patients with staphylococcus infection–associated glomerulonephritis usually have numerous underlying comorbidities such as diabetes. Serum complement levels are low in less than 50% of patients with staphylococcus infection– associated glomerulonephritis, while they are low in approximately 90% of patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. The kidney biopsy findings can be similar, but in staphylococcus infection–associated glomerulonephritis, the glomerular deposits usually (but not always) contain IgA, in addition to C3. Large subepithelial deposits (humps) occur in approximately 30 percent of biopsies with staphylococcus infection–associated glomerulonephritis; they are practically always seen in active poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Obviously, the safest differential diagnostic tool is to identify staphylococcus as the infectious agent, which, unfortunately, can be difficult. Blood cultures may be negative, and sometimes the site of infection is not obvious. If there is cellulitis or an infected wound, cultures from the infected site should be performed. There are morphologic overlaps between membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, which can make the diagnosis difficult. Occasionally, humps can occur but, in a typical case of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, the glomerular capillary deposits are mainly subendothelial and there is concomitant IgG staining. Also, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is not a self-limiting disease, unlike poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. A glomerulonephritis with membranoproliferative pattern without IgG deposits now should be classified as C3 glomerulonephritis/C3 glomerulopathy (see above). In this patient, the absence of IgG in the glomerular capillary deposits, the numerous humps, the absence of subendothelial deposits, and the fast recovery without steroid treatment make the diagnosis of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis unlikely.'},\n",

       "  'explanation_text': 'Methenamine silver stain revealed several double contours along the glomerular capillary loops (Image 2). There was mild to moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy involving approximately 25% to 30% of the renal cortex. Several nonatrophic tubules showed segmental glassy PAS-positive thickening of the tubular basement membrane (Image 3). The vasculature was unremarkable. A Thioflavin T stain showed linear, ribbon-like staining along the glomerular (Image 4) and many tubular basement membranes. Frozen sections cut for immunofluorescence contained three glomeruli. There was moderate, somewhat segmental but diffuse, ribbon-like glomerular capillary fluorescence for C3 (Image 5). Along some glomerular capillary loops, the C3 staining had linear double contours. Coarsely granular mesangial deposits were also seen, which, under immersion oil, had a ring-like appearance (Image 6). There was widespread but segmental ribbon-like tubular basement membrane staining for C3 as well. Antibodies to other immunoreactants (IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q, kappa and lambda light chains, fibrinogen, and albumin) did not show relevant glomerular or tubulointerstitial fluorescence. Two glomeruli were available for electron microscopy. Ultrastructurally, very electron-dense, ribbonlike, intramembranous deposits were seen along the glomerular capillary basement membrane (Image 8). Mesangial dense deposits were also seen. Ribbon-like electron-dense deposits were noted in numerous tubular basement membranes as well (Image 9). There was approximately 50% foot process effacement. No endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions were identified. The ultrastructural findings are diagnostic of DDD. DDD was formerly called type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis because the glomeruli frequently displayed a membranoproliferative pattern of injury. However, DDD is now classified under C3 glomerulopathy. C3 glomerulopathy is a glomerular disease characterized by C3 accumulation in the glomeruli in the form of electron-dense deposits. Patients have either genetic or acquired abnormalities in the activation of the alternate complement pathway. Although the glomeruli in DDD most frequently have a membranoproliferative pattern, other morphologic patterns such as segmental proliferative lesions (current case) may occur. The characteristic finding is granular to linear, ribbon-like glomerular C3 deposits. It is not uncommon that, using immersion oil and an x100 objective, the ribbon-like deposits have double contours and the mesangial deposits appear as mesangial rings under the immunofluorescence microscope. It is likely that the C3 staining is strongest at the periphery of the deposits. However, such fine double-contours and mesangial rings are not always evident, particularly if the freezing technique of the kidney biopsy and cutting of frozen sections are not optimal. The diagnostic lesion in DDD is seen under the electron microscope in the form of very dense, homogeneous, intramembranous ribbon-like or sausage-like electron-dense deposits embedded in the glomerular basement membrane. Young patients, such as this patient, usually have genetic abnormalities involving one of the genes encoding complement regulatory proteins (most frequently factor H and its regulatory proteins). C3 nephritic factor is common in DDD. Sometimes antibodies to factor H may be found. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis frequently has C3-restricted deposits in the glomeruli, and in rare instances even elongated intramembranous deposits similar to the sausage-like deposits in DDD. However, in postinfectious (in particular in poststreptococcal) glomerulonephritis, the deposits are mostly mesangial and subepithelial. In poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis there are many large subepithelial deposits (humps). In rare instances the differential diagnosis may be difficult because occasionally humps may also occur in DDD, and there is now evidence that infection may occasionally trigger the development of C3 glomerulopathy. Serum C3 levels are depressed in both DDD and postinfectious glomerulonephritis. Fortunately, because of the characteristic ultrastructural findings, the diagnosis of DDD is usually obvious. Linear to ribbon-like glomerular and tubular basement membrane deposits are seen in monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease. However, in monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease the deposits stain for a light or, less commonly, for a heavy chain. C3 staining is usually negative, unless the monoclonal deposit is a complement fixing heavy chain. Although the deposits in monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease are present within the glomerular and tubular basement membrane, their appearance is different. In monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease the deposits are finely granular punctate electron dense deposits, not the homogeneous dense deposits of DDD. DDD occasionally can be associated with an underlying monoclonal gammopathy, particularly in older patients. But even if DDD is related to monoclonal gammopathy, the diagnosis is DDD, associated with an underlying monoclonal gammopathy. Thioflavin T is a sensitive stain for amyloid deposition. However, it is less specific than the Congo red stain. Occasionally deposits in DDD are also positive for Thioflavin T, such as in this patient’s biopsy. None of the findings in this young patient are suggestive of amyloidosis. Why thioflavin T stain is sometimes positive in DDD and its clinical significance are currently unclear. DDD was called MPGN type II in the past, as mentioned above. According to current criteria, MPGN can only be diagnosed if the glomerular deposits, in addition to C3, also contain an immunoglobulin (IgG).

Paraffin sections for light microscopy contained 15 glomeruli, five of which were globally sclerotic. In three glomeruli, segmental to global glomerular capillary collapse was seen with prominent overlying glomerular epithelial cells (Image A, arrows).',\n",
       "  'explanation_text': 'The remaining glomeruli were somewhat enlarged, but otherwise unremarkable (Image B). There was moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy with moderate lymphoplasmacytic interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrate. Several tubules showed microcystic dilatation and contained homogeneous hyaline-like material (Image B, stars). Focal obliterative thickening of the arterioles was noted (Image B, arrow). Tissue for immunofluorescence contained six glomeruli; no immune complex deposits were noted. Ultrastructural examination revealed unremarkable glomerular capillary loops with no electrondense immune-type deposits and approximately 60% effacement of the foot processes (Image C). Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions were not seen. Collapsing glomerulopathy may be secondary to HIV infection (HIV-associated nephropathy); however, this patient is HIV negative. Hepatitis C virus infection is not associated with collapsing glomerulopathy unless the patient was treated with interferon; interferon treatment can rarely be associated with collapsing glomerulopathy. There was no history of interferon treatment in this patient. Rarely, other viral infections, such as parvovirus infection, have been associated with collapsing nephropathy. In addition to interferon, other drugs, such as pamidronate, can cause collapsing glomerulopathy. In this patient, there is no clear cause; therefore, the collapsing glomerulopathy is best considered idiopathic. However, it is important to note that the patient is an African American woman, and collapsing glomerulopathy is more common in African Americans with APOL1 risk alleles (this patient had not been tested for that). Collapsing glomerulopathy has quite characteristic changes, not only in the glomeruli (collapsing glomerular capillaries with prominent epithelial cells filling the Bowman space) but frequently in the tubulointerstitium as well, including interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, and microcystic dilatation of tubules. This patient had all the characteristic findings of collapsing glomerulopathy. Occasionally, the prominent glomerular epithelial cells filling Bowman’s capsule may resemble a cellular crescent (“pseudocrescent”). However, in true cellular crescents, the glomerular capillaries and Bowman capsular basement membrane are frequently disrupted, and the epithelial cells in the Bowman space are admixed with inflammatory cells and fibrin. In the collapsing variant of FSGS, the hypertrophic glomerular epithelial cells probably represent podocytes (visceral epithelial cells), but there is increasing evidence that parietal epithelial cells also contribute to the glomerular epithelial hyperplasia. Differentiating the collapsing variant of FSGS from the cellular variant can be difficult, particularly if the collapsing variant is in an early stage. In fact, there were some investigators who designated glomerular capillary collapse with prominent overlying epithelial cells as the cellular lesion. According to the Columbia Classification, the cellular variant of FSGS is defined by segmental endocapillary hypercellularity with subsequent glomerular capillary obliteration, with or without glomerular intracapillary foam cells, hyalinosis, infiltrating leukocytes, karyorrhexis, and epithelial hyperplasia. The presence of prominent glomerular epithelial cells in the cellular variant of FSGS makes the differentiation from the collapsing variant difficult. This is reflected in the literature; studies on FSGS using the Columbia classification report large differences in the frequency of the cellular variant (between 0 and 27 percent). This explains why the cellular variant is the most poorly understood among the different variants of FSGS.'},\n",

Up to 10 glomeruli per section had areas of segmental sclerosis localized to the glomerular tip, the area of Bowman capsule where the proximal tubule originates (see arrow on Image A).',\n",
       "  'explanation_text': 'Some of these tip lesions contained foam cells (see at the tip of the arrow). Most glomeruli were enlarged but otherwise unremarkable under the light microscope (see Image B). Immunofluorescence did not reveal immune complex deposits. Electron microscopy indicated diffuse foot process effacement, normal glomerular basement membranes, and no electrondense immune-type deposits (Image C). Glomerular tip lesion, although classified as a variant of FSGS in the Columbia Classification, is clinically more similar to minimal change disease; patients with isolated glomerular tip lesions (no other light microscopic abnormality, absence of immune complex deposition) frequently present with nephrotic syndrome responsive to steroid treatment. Other forms of FSGS (perihilar, collapsing, cellular, and not otherwise specified [NOS] variants) are more commonly steroid resistant and have a worse outcome. Glomerular tip lesion is classified as a form of FSGS because, unlike minimal change disease, not all glomeruli are normal on light microscopy; some of them show segmental sclerosis/adhesion at the origin of the proximal tubule (the glomerular tip). Immune complex deposits are absent and there is widespread foot process effacement. The definition of the tip lesion vary between investigators; according to the Columbia classification of FSGS, up to 25% of the glomerular tuft can be obliterated by sclerosis at or close to the vascular pole. Others consider less extensive segmental lesions as true tip lesions. We believe that the glomerular tip lesion is a nonspecific reaction of the glomerulus that can be seen in a variety of glomerular diseases with heavy proteinuria, including minimal change disease and FSGS, but also membranous glomerulopathy and diabetic nephropathy. The pathogenesis of the tip lesion is unclear, but it is possible that it is related to herniation of the glomerular capillary tufts into the origin of the proximal tubules, podocyte injury, and subsequent adhesions of the glomerular capillaries to the glomerular tip. As pointed out above, most patients with isolated glomerular tip lesions and heavy proteinuria will respond to steroids just like minimal change disease. Steroid-resistant patients frequently develop progressive FSGS. Unfortunately, there are no consistent markers to predict which patient with glomerular tip lesion will behave like minimal change disease and which will have progressive FSGS.'},\n",

       "  'explanation_text': 'Image 1 Image A Image 1: Mesangial Proliferative GN – Image D IgA nephropathy is a GN defined by the IF finding of mesangial IgA that is dominant (stronger staining) over IgG (or occasionally co-dominant with IgG). The LM patterns associated with IgA nephropathy are variable. The most common, as seen here, is mesangial proliferation (capillary lumens are open) where the PAS reaction highlights the mild increase in mesangial matrix and cells. Other common patterns include segmental sclerosis (associated with proteinuria), endocapillary proliferative GN, and crescentic GN. IgA nephropathy may be normal by LM. The IF pattern shows strong staining restricted to the mesangium. In contrast, IgA dominant post-infectious GN (seen usually in diabetics) shows deposits primarily along the capillary wall (subepithelial humps). Image 2 Image B Image 2: Exudative Endocapillary Proliferative GN – Image E This H&E stain shows global endocapillary proliferation, with associated occlusion of the capillary lumens. Much of the hypercellularity is due to the influx of inflammatory cells that are difficult to recognize by LM. Neutrophils are the distinctive exception, hence the designation “exudative” when they are present. This LM pattern while non-specific is usually associated with IC deposition on IF. The associated pattern of IgG deposition seen here is predominantly that of “starry sky,” ie, finely granular mesangial and endocapillary deposits, with occasional “humps” seen along the capillary walls. This pattern is typical of post-infectious GN and usually seen early in the course of the disease. An alternate early pattern is the “garland,” which may have a worse prognosis. With time, these patterns often evolve into deposition limited to the mesangium. Image 3 Image C Image 3: Membranoproliferative GN – Image C The Jones stain shows mesangial and segmental endocapillary proliferation and especially highlights duplicated glomerular basement membranes (“tram tracking”). Also seen are silver negative deposits between the membranes, as well as occasionally within capillary lumens. These pseudothrombi (as opposed to true fibrin thrombi) are typical of lupus nephritis as well as cryoglobulinemic GN. The monoclonal component of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (associated with hepatitis C infection) is almost always IgM kappa. The strong polyclonal IgM dominant staining seen here in the mesangium and also along capillary walls (with only minimal accompanying IgG) suggests chronic viral infections such as hepatitis C, sometimes with associated cryoglobulins, as seen in this patient. Image 4 Image D Image 4: Crescentic (Extracapillary Proliferative) GN – Image A While this PAS section does not stain the cytoplasm of the cells present in the urinary space, it does highlight the presence of a crescent by delineating its boundaries - staining the tuft, as well as the membrane of Bowman capsule. Segmental necrosis, accompanied by fibrin in the urinary space, incites crescent development as illustrated by the strong staining for fibrin within a segment of the glomerulus and in the urinary space. These findings are common to all crescentic GN, regardless of etiology. Crescentic GN are classified on the basis of their IF findings, a model for the classification system proposed by Sethi. This patient showed no significant Ig or C3 deposition (“pauci-immune”), a finding strongly associated with ANCA vasculitis (in this case due to high titer anti-MPO). Image 5 Image E Image 5: Segmental Sclerosis - Image B Sclerosis, the glomerular scaring process defined by architectural obliteration due to increased matrix, can be the end result of proliferative GN. Segmental necrosis, for example, can “heal” as segmental sclerosis, as seen here. While the lower half of the tuft appears normal, the upper side shows areas of increased PAS positive matrix with loss of normal structure. Some of these foci show strongly PAS positive refractile hyaline droplets, reflecting plasma proteins that have “exudated” into the areas of chronic injury. The corresponding IF pattern reveals the non-specific deposition (or entrapment) of IgM and C3 from the circulation within areas of sclerosis. These coarse and chunky deposits are not present in uninvolved areas, and thus do not suggest a complement-mediated GN.'},\n",

Ultrastructural examination confirms the paucity of deposits; only segmental scattered subendothelial and a few paramesangial deposits are seen without substructure.

In this case, the patient’s urine osmolality increases appropriately with water restriction, reflecting an intact ADH secretory mechanism. Further administration of desmopressin does not increase urine osmolality. It is also to be noted that patients with psychogenic polydypsia may wash out some of the medullary concentrating gradient due to chronic water overload, and hence cannot concentrate their urine to more than 500-600 mOsmol/Kg. In the second scenario, the patient’s sodium has risen after an overnight water restriction, but his urine specific gravity remains dilute.

There have been reports with minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS), membranoproliferative disease (MPGN), and crescentic glomerulonephritis. However, in most of the published cases of thymoma associated with nephrotic syndrome, histological examination indicates minimal change disease as described in the case in AJKD. FSGS is rarely associated with solid tumors. Of these, RCC and thymoma are the most frequently reported. Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and all forms of leukemias are found with FSGS. Myeloproliferative disorders, like essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, have been reported with FSGS. Many solid tumor malignancies have been associated with membranous nephropathy. The pathogenesis of cancer-associated membranous nephropathy is believed to involve deposition of in situ formation of glomerular immune complexes. As seen above, breast cancer, teratomas, and cervical cancers are most commonly associated with membranous nephropathy. Minimal change diseases can be seen with tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, as well as hematologic malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas. IgA nephropathy has been found with solid tumors of the respiratory tract, the buccal mucosa, and nasopharynx. IgA nephropathy is a disorder of the mucosal immune system which constitutively secretes IgA capable of forming immune complexes. Tumors of the mucosal immune system, particularly of the upper respiratory tract, have a significant association with IgA nephropathy. Recent associations have been described between MPGN and monoclonal gammopathy of unclear significance (MGUS). MPGN with MGUS should be a clue to underlying chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Mayo Clinic analyzed kidney biopsies of patients with MPGN, and the most important association were with a monoclonal gammopathy. MPGN also can be seen in other leukemias, gastrointestinal tumors, and melanomas. Thrombotic microangiopathy has been observed in patients with mucin-producing gastric, lung, and breast cancers. Crescentic glomerulonephritis can be seen in lung cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and renal cell carcinoma to name a few. AA amyloidosis is a paraneoplastic syndrome that is often overlooked, and associated with Hodgkin disease, renal cell carcinoma, bladder and gastric cancers, and sarcoma of the spleen.

Amyloidosis is Congo Red positive with an often nodular appearance on light microscopy. When due to monoclonal light chain (AL type), the immunofluorescence shows staining for one but not the other light chain. The electron microscopy (EM) shows randomly arranged fibrils 8-10 nm in diameter. Monoclonal immunoglobulin disease (light-chain deposition disease, heavy chain deposition disease, light and heavy chain deposition disease)is Congo Red negative and monotypic light and/or heavy chains on immunofluorescence. EM shows amorphous deposits that are usually finely granular. Immunotactoid glomerulopathy (immunotactoid glomerulonephritis) is Congo Red negative, with variable lesions on light microscopy such as mesangial proliferative changes or a membranoproliferative pattern. The immunofluorescence shows mostly monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM, however, an M spike or cryoglobulins cannot be demonstrated in the circulation. EM shows 30-90 nm hollow microtubules arranged as parallel stacks. The process is often associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. Fibrillary glomerular disease (fibrillary glomerulonephritis) is Congo Red negative, with variable light microscopy findings, similar to immunotactoid glomerulonephritis. Immunofluorescence shows IgG and C3 with equivalent kappa and lambda light chains. The EM shows non-branching fibrils, randomly arranged in an amorphous matrix. The fibrils are larger than amyloid and measure around 20nm. Cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis is Congo Red negative, with a diffuse proliferative, membranoprolierative, or mesangioproliferative pattern. “Pseudothrombi” can be seen in the glomerular capillaries. Immunofluorescence findings depend on the type: monotypic immunoglobulin if type 1 and polycolonal IgG or IgM if type 2. The EM often shows curved microtubular arrays. Collagenofibrotic glomerulopathy is Congo Red negative, with light microscopy showing a membranoproliferative pattern of injury. Immunofluorescence reveals strong IgM, IgG, C3, and collagen III staining. The EM shows fibrillary deposits with transverse band structures and periodicity of 60nm. Fibronectin glomerulonephritis is Congo Red negative, with light microscopy showing large periodic acid–Schiff positive deposits.

The 3 glomerular diseases were membranoproliferative GN, mesangioproliferative GN, and membranous glomerulopathy. Patients with kidney involvement had a significantly shorter disease duration compared to patients without kidney disease. Hence the most common finding is tubulointerstitial disease. In Case number 1, the bland urine sediment suggests this disease, and the most correct answer is B. With regard to questions 2 and 3, Maripuri et al looked at a series of patients with SS. In 24 biopsies, most showed tubulo-interstitial disease with a variety of glomerular lesions: FSGS, mild mesangial sclerosis, MPGN, minimal change disease, and membranous nephropathy were reported. The sudden onset of nephrotic syndrome with an elevated CD80 in question 2 points towards a diagnosis of MCD. Hence the correct answer is B. In the Maripuri et al study, 46% of the kidney biopsies showed chronic tubulo-interstitial disease, 25% showed acute tubulo-interstitial disease, 13% were FSGS, 8% MPGN, and 4% were MCD and membranous nephropathy each.

       "  'explanation_text': 'Choice no 1 was initially described in hyponatremic athletes participating in endurance events such as marathon races. It consists of 100 mL of 3 percent saline given as an intravenous bolus, which should acutely raise the serum sodium concentration by 2 to 3 meq/L, thereby reducing the degree of cerebral edema; if neurologic symptoms persist or worsen, a 100 mL bolus of 3 percent saline can be repeated one or two more times at 10 minute intervals The rationale for this approach is that, in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, rapid increases in serum sodium of approximately 4 to 6 meq/L can reverse severe symptoms such as seizures.\\xa0If you use this approach, you might not need to do much for the remaining time over 24 hours and patient can start self correcting. Giving a bolus of 3% is not agreed upon by many Nephrologist. Take a look at the recent review that I pubmed below for a nice algorithm. \\xa0The usual goals for the overall rate of correction are to raise the serum sodium less than 10 meq/L in the first 24 hours and less than 18 meq/L in the first 48 hours. Choice B which is giving a drip of 3%Nacl initially at a fast rate should also work in such instances and perhaps physicians might feel more comfortable using that approach. The rate of 3% given in the third choice might be too slow for someone who is symptomatic. So the most accurate answer is Choice A, but as you can see, there is no hard data and people might use diverse options( B>C as the next best answer). Giving a bolus of 3%NACL – where is this data coming from? When looked at Neurosurgical patients with cerebral edema who were normonatremic, a 30cc bolus of 23.4% saline increased the Na by 5mmol/L and there was an excellent and quick reversal of herniation. A 30cc of 23.4% saline is equal to 240cc of 3% saline. Based on these findings and a recent study on exercise induced hyponatremia in marathon runners, the International Exercise Associated Hyponatremia consensus development conference recommends that any athlete with hyponatremia and acute changes that are symptomatic ( seizures, encephalopathy) should be treated with 100ml of 3% NACL to acutely reduce brain edema. Two additional doses can be given over a 10 minute interval if there is no improvement.\\xa0 Experts think that this approach is reasonable in any case of SEVERE ACUTE SYMPTOMATIC hyponatremia. Get the symptoms better, and then when you get to safe zone, you can correct more slowly or apply brakes with D5W or ddavp if need be. \\xa0If the cause was acute, rapid correction is warranted.\\xa0Chronic hyponatremia is a different story and asymptomatic acute is also a different story.'},\n",

Due to a proxmial RTA, kids get rickets. By mid adulthood, one can get CKD-ESRD. \\xa0Amiloride and HCTZ might be beneficial in treating the disease. Geller Syndrome\\xa0is an extremely rare disorder that usually presents in pregnancy. It is caused by missense mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor(MR) leading to severe hypertension with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis can occur. This entity should be suspected in a previously normotensive patient who develops severe hypertension and hypokalemia during pregnancy, particularly during second and third trimester, when progesterone levels are high. Spironolactone is ineffective as the mutated receptor is not blocked by it. Patients should be managed with antihypertensive agents. Subsequent to delivery, when progesterone level normalizes, patients become normotensive again. Denys Drash Syndrome\\xa0is\\xa0characterized by the following conditions: gonadal dysgenesis,diffuse mesangial sclerosis and FSGS with high risk of Wilm's Tumor. Clinically, they have\\xa0loss of playfulness, decreased appetite, weight loss, growth delay, abnormal skeletal development, insomnia, abdominal pain, constipation as well.\\xa0Electron microscopy reveals hypertrophic mesangial cells surrounded by an abundant mesangial matrix, which often contains collagen fibrils. The podocytes are hypertrophied and contain many vacuoles. There is also irregular effacement of foot processes with focal detachment of the epithelial cell from the glomerular basement membrane. Fraiser Syndrome\\xa0also causes FSGS.\\xa0Frasier syndrome presents at birth with male pseudohermaphroditism (the external genetalia have a female appearance despite an XY genotype), streak gonads and progressive glomerulonephropathy (focal segemental glomerulosclerosis). Patients are also at increased risk of genitourinary tumours (usually gonadoblastoma).\\xa0The glomerulonephropathy presents later than in Denys-Drash syndrome, and the tumour risk phenotype is different - whilst DDS is associated with Wilms' tumour, Frasier syndrome is associated with gonadoblastoma.

       "  'explanation_text': \"A recent editorial in\\xa0Nature Nephrology from Feb 2010\\xa0issue talks about the difference in these two phenomenon (escape vs Breakthrough). Aldosterone escape (AE) is as follows: when you have too much aldesterone in your body, there is an initial decrease in urinary sodium excretion, and renal sodium retention is increased.\\xa0However, urinary sodium excretion subsequently increases to balance the sodium intake before detectable edema develops. This phenomenon is called AE and is the reason why edema formation is not a characteristic of primary hyperaldo state. \\xa0Multiple mechanisms as described in the above linked editorial are responsible for the AE and prevention of edema. What is Aldosterone Breaktrough (AB): When we uses ACEI and ARBS medication to inhibit the RAAS system, large increase in renin occurs in administration of these medications. People who treat hypertension with a renin or non renin mediated methods are familiar to this concept that renin will increase with ACEI and ARBs initiation, when you check the level in the plasma, its high. \\xa0Interestingly after several weeks of using these medication, the aldosterone level returns to pre treatment levels in 30-40% of patients. This phenomenon is called AB. \\xa0Patients who develop this might have worse outcomes and eventually start not responding to ACEI and ARBS. \\xa0This editorial suggests that perhaps direct renin inhibitors or Vitamin D might decrease that renin drive and exert a better profile. I think we need to know about this novel concept often confused with the escape. We can't really\\xa0escape\\xa0from this new\\xa0breakthrough.\"},\n",

Onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus in this thin young woman is another clinical feature of pheochromocytoma. The presence of systolic heart failure in this setting is most consistent with catecholamine cardiomyopathy (also known as stress or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy), an entity that may complicate pheochromocytoma. Therefore, option C is the best answer. Stress cardiomyopathy is more common in woman. An international registry showed that about 90% of individuals with the diagnosis were women. As compared to stress cardiomyopathy that is not associated with pheochromocytoma, patients with pheochromocytoma are younger, are more likely to have a global pattern of cardiac involvement, and frequently have a dramatic clinical presentation with high complication rates. The absence of an antecedent group A streptococcal infection and criteria for acute rheumatic fever (i.e., modified major Jones criteria are carditis and valvulitis, arthritis, Sydenham chorea, subcutaneous nodules, and/or erythema marginatum) does not support a diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease (option A is incorrect).

Hence, option D is best answer. Increasing obesity, particularly visceral obesity, is associated with somewhat higher aldosterone levels, particularly in men. Aldosterone is an important mediator of obesity-related hypertension. Hence, use of aldosterone antagonists for the treatment of resistant hypertension in obesity is appropriate. Data from the recent PATHWAY-2 study also showed that use of a mineralocorticoid antagonist was the most effective fourth-line agent for the treatment of resistant hypertension. In primary aldosteronism, the plasma aldosterone concentration is usually >15 ng/dl and the plasma aldosterone-to-plasma renin activity ratio is >20. To note, the 2016 Endocrine Society guidelines indicate that primary aldosteronism can infrequently occur with seated plasma aldosterone levels <15 ng/dl. Stowasser and Gordon found that 36% of 74 patients diagnosed with primary aldosteronism with aldosterone-renin ratios >20 who failed to suppress aldosterone during fludrocortisone-suppression tests had seated plasma aldosterone levels <15 ng/dL. Bilateral adrenal NephSAP hyperplasia was more common than aldosterone-producing adenomas in these individuals. Therefore, some experts recommend further testing for all patients with aldosterone-renin ratios >20 except for instances when the plasma aldosterone level is £6 ng/dl with fludrocortisone suppression testing. This patient does not meet initial screening criteria for primary aldosteronism (the aldosterone-renin ratio is 16). Therefore, option A is incorrect. This man does not have secondary hyperaldosteronism because the plasma renin activity is low (option B is incorrect). Type 1 familial hyperaldosteronism (also known as glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism) is an autosomal dominant disorder in which aldosterone is synthesized in the zona fasciculate in response to corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH-sensitive aldosterone production occurs because of a chimeric gene formed by fusion of the promoter region of the gene encoding 11-beta-hydroxylase with the gene encoding aldosterone synthetase. Individuals with type 1 familial hyperaldosteronism usually develop hypertension before age 21. This man’s clinical course and laboratory findings are not consistent with type 1 familial hyperaldosteronism; therefore, option C is incorrect.'},\n",

The family history of glomus tumors and typical clinical manifestations of pheochromocytoma support a diagnosis of familial pheochromocytoma. Glomus tumors and carotid body tumors are paragangliomas. They are often not secretory. Clinicians often fail to associate these rare head and neck tumors with genetic susceptibility to pheochromocytoma. Mutations causing familial pheochromocytoma are autosomal dominant. Germline mutations are present in up to 40% of patients with pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. These mutations are more frequent in pheochromocytoma than for any other solid tumor type. All patients with a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma should be referred for genetic testing. Genetic testing may reveal mutations in genes associated with an increased risk of metastatic disease (succinate dehydrogenase mutations [SDHB]) and may aid in facilitating earlier diagnosis in relatives. Therefore, option A is correct.

The low urinary 24-hour free cortisone level and markedly increased urine cortisol-to-cortisone are most consistent with inactivating mutations of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11βHSD2). Decreased activity of 11βHSD2 enables glucocorticoids to activate the mineralocorticoid receptor. Features of this syndrome include increased sodium-chloride cotransporter and epithelial sodium channel activity in the aldosterone sensitive portion of the distal tubule and collecting duct, renal sodium retention, increased sodium appetite, volume expansion, and vasoconstriction, all of which contribute to hypertension. Therefore, blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor with spironolactone is the next most appropriate medication to add to this patient’s antihypertensive regimen. Thiazide diuretics or mineralocorticoid antagonists increase distal sodium excretion and effectively synergize with the loop diuretic. Unlike thiazide diuretics, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist would also reduce potassium excretion and may even reduce this patient’s salt appetite. Hence, spironolactone is favored over a thiazide diuretic as the next agent to add to this man’s antihypertensive regimen. Volume expansion in 11βHSD2 deficiency down regulates the renin-angiotensin system. Therefore, further suppression of the renin-angiotensin system with irbesartan or aliskiren is not warranted. In addition, combination angiotensin blockade is not recommended due to higher rates of acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia. Hence, options A and B are incorrect.

       "  'explanation_text': 'In oncogenic osteomalacia, it is proposed that the tumors, typically of vascular origin, produce excess amounts of Phosphatonin, a non-PTH phosphaturic hormone that originates from osteoblasts and is involved in bone metabolism. Phosphatonin is present in a quantity that exceeds the degradative capacity of the endopeptidase (PEX) that normally prevents high circulating levels. The Phosphatonin now escapes into the circulation and eventually produces the same renal effects as seen in patients with X-Linked Hypophosphatemia. The latter is a disease in which the PEX endopeptidase is defective or absent secondary to a gene mutation also leading to high Phosphatonin levels but in this case secondary to decreased degradation. Proof for the role of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) in oncogenic osteomalacia has come from studies in which tumors or tumor cell lines from patients with oncogenic osteomalacia have been found to produce this protein. FGF-23 is phosphaturic and is degraded by PEX making it a prime candidate for designation as Phosphatonin. PTHrP produces the hypercalcemia of malignancy and this patient is normocalcemic. Stanniocalcin is a phosphaturic hormone that is found in fish. While the gene for Stanniocalcin is expressed in humans, its role in producing a phosphaturic condition has not been proven. Increased PHEX gene activity would lower Phosphatonin levels, as it is the gene that encodes the degrading endopeptidase. Genetic defects of the Na Pi II transporter are not associated with spontaneously occurring oncogenic osteomalacia.'},\n",

       "  'explanation_text': 'The patient has developed hypotonic hyponatremia because of the non-osmotic release of vasopressin caused by the stress of surgery coupled with the intravenous administration of a large volume of hypotonic fluid.  Her complaints of headache and vomiting are strongly suggestive of cerebral edema, a complication that has been reported primarily in pre-menopausal women with postoperative hyponatremia.  As this syndrome may be fatal, prompt, definitive treatment is needed to raise the serum sodium concentration over the next few hours. Neither isotonic saline nor fluid restriction is satisfactory strategies to accomplish this goal.  Extracellular fluid volume expansion created by the post-operative and peri-operative fluid will cause the patient to excrete large amounts of sodium in her urine.  Vasopressin levels may remain elevated for several days after surgery, which will cause her urine to be concentrated.  Thus, the sodium in each liter of isotonic saline she is given may be excreted in less than one liter of urine; the infusate will thus be “desalinated”, causing positive water balance and worsening of hyponatremia.  Because of her volume expanded state, the patient may excrete the equivalent of hypertonic saline in her urine even if intravenous fluids are discontinued; as a result her serum sodium concentration may continue to fall spontaneously.  Thus, intravenous hypertonic saline is needed to decrease the severity of cerebral edema and eliminate the risk of herniation. As hyponatremia has evolved over 48 hours, there is some risk of osmotic demyelination if the serum sodium concentration is increased too much (>18 mEq/L in 48 hours).  Choice C will raise the serum sodium concentration by 17 mEq/L in less than 24 hours; as post-operative vasopressin levels begin to fall spontaneously, the ensuing water diuresis may result in excessive correction.  As brain swelling of more than 5 to 10% is incompatible with life, a 5% increase in serum sodium concentration (an increase of 6 mEq/L) is enough to bring the patient out of danger without risking iatrogenic injury from excessive correction.'},\n",

In acutely ill patients, the maximum rate of glucose metabolism has been estimated to be 10 to 20 g/hr in a 70 kg patient. Infusion of D5W at 500 ml/hr provides 25 g per hour and will predictably cause hyperglycemia, even if insulin is provided.

Unlike patients with intact renal function who develop hyperglycemic, hyperosmolar, non-ketotic coma, they are not volume depleted or dehydrated.  Rather, extracellular fluid volume is expanded (sometimes enough to cause congestive heart failure) by two processes: glucose ingested with water to quench thirst; and attraction of cellular water to the extracellular fluid by extracellular hypertonicity.  The patient presented in this question has a serum sodium concentration of 100 mmol/l and blood glucose of 1800 mg/dl (100 mmol/l); thus, his plasma tonicity is elevated at 300 mOsm/kg.   He has clinical signs of volume expansion with hypertension, jugular venous distention, an S3 gallop and crackles in his lungs.  Thus, administration of 2 liters of additional fluid (choices A to D) is contraindicated.  Administration of insulin without fluid (a maneuver that would not be appropriate in most patients with intact renal function who become severely hyperglycemic) will correct the hyperkalemia by driving potassium into cells and it will improve congestive heart failure by allowing fluid to return to cells as glucose is metabolized.'},\n",

       "  'explanation_text': 'Hyponatremia is a poor prognostic finding in congestive heart failure.  It reflects vasopressin secretion, which is part of the neuroendocrine response to an inadequate circulation.  In the case presented here, the patient has become hyponatremic while on furosemide.  However, because hyponatremia has evolved while the patient was becoming more edematous with an extremely low urine sodium concentration, the diuretic is unlikely to be the cause of the electrolyte disturbance.  Furosemide interferes with urinary concentration and is therefore an uncommon cause of hyponatremia. Metolazone, choice A is a thiazide-type diuretic.  As this agent permits the urine to be maximally concentrated, substitution of this agent for furosemide is likely to exacerbate the patient’s tendency to hyponatremia.  Demeclocycline, choice B, may be effective as an aquaretic, because it interferes with vasopressin’s action on the collecting duct.  However, the demeclocycline accumulates in liver disease, causing nephrotoxicity; it is therefore a poor choice in a patient with severe congestive heart failure and hepatic congestion.  Discontinuation of all diuretics (choice C) is unlikely to be helpful in correcting the hyponatremia and it will permit edema to progress.  Choice E is incorrect; although the calculated serum osmolality is only slightly low (2 x 118 + 84/2.8 + 120/18 = 273), the serum osmolality is increased by urea, which has no effect on plasma tonicity. The patient is developing progressive edema on her current dose of furosemide and she has a low urine sodium concentration.  Diuretics have a dose-response curve characterized by no natriuresis until a threshold rate of drug excretion is attained. In congestive heart failure, decreased intestinal perfusion, reduced intestinal motility, and perhaps mucosal edema may substantially slow the rate of drug absorption and therefore the rate of drug delivery to the kidney. There may also be decreased diuretic secretion into the tubular lumen because of decreased renal perfusion.  In this setting, apparent resistance to seemingly adequate doses of oral furosemide may be overcome by increasing the dose (choice D).  Hyponatremia does not contraindicate this therapy.  Indeed, urine excreted in response to furosemide will have a lower sodium concentration than plasma; thus an increased urine output increases free water excretion, correcting hyponatremia.'},\n",

In one study, mean arterial pressure fell slightly during CRRT with lactate-buffered fluids and increased when bicarbonate-buffer was used.  No difference in mortality in patients on CRRT has been associated with use of lactate- or bicarbonate-buffered fluids. Lactate-buffered fluids are associated with greater chemical stability than bicarbonate-buffered fluids.  Bicarbonate is in equilibrium with carbonic acid, which spontaneously breaks down to corm carbon dioxide and water.  Most of the flexible plastic bags used for preparation of fluids are permeable to gases, including carbon dioxide. Over time, the concentration of buffer decreases due to the loss of carbon dioxide.

The optimal therapy is therefore to discontinue the ampicillin and begin an alternative antibiotic agent to treat the endocarditis (choice B).

Although the absence of the previously noted right sided hydronephrosis might be construed as indicating resolution of obstruction, the fact that she has now developed ARF with mild left sided dilatation suggests bilateral obstruction with  compression of the right sided collecting system by her bulky retroperitoneal disease.  In addition, no other etiologies for ARF are suggested by her history and physical examination. Diagnostic procedures that might be considered at this point include cystoscopy with retrograde pyelography, percutaneous nephrostomy with antegrade pyelography, or a radionucleotide excretion study.  Either of the first two studies have the advantage of combining diagnostic information with decompression of the urinary tract.  Given the high index of suspicion of obstructive disease, the additional value of the radionucleotide excretion study would be small.  While a CT scan would provide additional information regarding the extent of her retroperitoneal disease, the use of IV contrast should be avoided, unless absolutely necessary, in the setting of ARF.  Allopurinol and urinary alkalinization would be indicated in the setting of acute urate nephropathy.  This is not a likely diagnosis in a patient with a uric acid of only 12.4 mg/dL.  There is no emergent indication for hemodialysis, and this would only delay the needed diagnostic/therapeutic intervention.

Increasing urine flow may “wash out” obstructing intraluminal cellular debris and casts, thereby reversing one of the mechanisms of renal dysfunction.  In addition, by decreasing active transport in the thick ascending loop of Henle, loop diuretics may decrease energy requirements and protect cells in a region of compromised perfusion.  Clinical studies, however, have not supported these arguments.  In randomized controlled trials, diuretic therapy was not associated with any improvement in mortality, decrease in the duration of ARF, or alteration in the need for renal replacement therapy.

       "  'explanation_text': 'This patient with type 1 diabetes has normal blood pressure and serum creatinine, but has microalbuminuria. She is at risk of developing overt diabetic nephropathy.  Option A is correct. Results of several large trials have demonstrated that intensive glucose control can significantly reduce the risk of progression from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy. Option B is incorrect as therapy with ACE inhibitors in normotensive type 1 diabetics reduced progression to overt nephropathy and in some cases was associated with the regression of microalbuminuria. Option C is incorrect since pancreas transplantation has been shown to reverse the lesions of diabetic nephropathy when studied 10 years following the pancreas transplant. Option D is incorrect since there is no data that dietary protein restriction can slow the development of nephropathy. Option E is incorrect. Serum potassium needs to be followed closely when initiating ACE inhibitor therapy but should be tried in this patient with a currently normal serum potassium.'},\n",
       " {'question_text': 'A 58-yr-old Asian man is seen in your office for assessment and treatment of his elevated serum creatinine. He was diagnosed by renal biopsy with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy 2 yr ago. Laboratory studies show serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl, calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 37 ml/min per 1.73 m2 by the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dl, hematocrit of 30%; urine protein-tocreatinine ratio of 2400 mg/g (normal _200 mg/g).

       "  'explanation_text': 'This patient has Stage 3 chronic kidney disease secondary to IgA nephropathy. His anemia is most likely secondary to decreased erythropoietin production. The first step in assessing his anemia is to measure serum iron, transferrin saturation and ferritin to make sure he is not iron deficient, a common contributing factor to anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Iron studies are also important in the planning of erythropoietin therapy since it is important to maintain transferrin saturation >20% and ferritin levels > 100 ng/ml. Therefore Option D is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect. Hemoglobin is a more accurate way of defining anemia since hematocrit measurements are more subject to shifts in plasma water and results can vary depending on the age of the sample and the methodology used. Option B is incorrect as erythropoietin levels are not directly related to the degree of decrease in GFR and in general have not been found to be useful in assessing anemia of chronic kidney disease. Levels are almost always inappropriately low for the level of hemoglobin. Option C is incorrect as a myelodysplastic syndrome is a rare cause of anemia and other clinical clues regarding its presence should be investigated prior to obtaining a bone marrow. Option E is incorrect as there is no evidence supporting a relationship between proteinuria and the response to erythropoietin treatment.'},\n",
